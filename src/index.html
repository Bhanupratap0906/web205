    <h1>Chemistry Assignment</h1>
    <p>Chemistry is the branch of science that deals with the properties, composition, and behavior of matter. It is a fascinating field that explores the building blocks of the <var>universe</var>.</p>

    <h2>Chemical Elements</h2>
    <p>The <span class = "custom-highlight">periodic table</span> is a tabular arrangement of chemical elements. Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, such as Fe for iron, H for hydrogen, and O for oxygen. Elements are classified into groups and periods based on their properties.</p>

    <h3>Chemical Equations</h3>
    <p>Chemical reactions are represented using <cite>chemical equations</cite>. Here's an example of a <dfn>chemical reaction</dfn>:</p>
    <p>2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> &rarr; 2H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
    <p>This equation represents the reaction between hydrogen gas (<var>H</var><sub>2</sub>) and oxygen gas (<var>O</var><sub>2</sub>) to form water (<var>H</var><sub>2</sub><var>O</var>).</p>

    <h4>Important Concepts</h4>
    <p> <b>Stoichiometry</b> is the calculation of reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves balancing chemical equations to ensure mass and charge are conserved.</p>
    <p><sub>Subscripts</sub> indicate the number of atoms of each element in a molecule, while <sup>superscripts</sup> represent charges or the number of atoms in an ion.</p>

    <h5>Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the world around us. From the composition of the air we breathe to the reactions that power our bodies, chemistry influences every aspect of our lives.</p>
